Project Overview:
This project focuses on early disease prediction using machine learning models, with a particular emphasis on breast cancer detection. The work demonstrates the application of various machine learning techniques including neural networks, random forests, and transformers for biomedical classification tasks.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing data, feature scaling, and train-test splitting

Multiple Model Implementations:

Neural Network (Sequential model with dense layers)

Random Forest Classifier

Transformer model (custom implementation)

Performance Evaluation: Includes accuracy metrics and confusion matrix visualization

Dataset: Uses the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset

Models Implemented
Neural Network

Architecture: 3 dense layers (32, 16, 1 neurons) with ReLU and sigmoid activations

Training: 50 epochs with binary cross-entropy loss

Achieved 85% accuracy on test data

Random Forest

100 estimators

Achieved 85% accuracy on test data
